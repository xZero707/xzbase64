Please note: This is for advanced users. If you didn't made any modifications to source and you don't wanna go through this process your self, then [download any of precompiled binary releases](https://github.com/xZero707/xzbase64/releases) for your OS (currently Windows only).

**What will you need:**

1. [PHC-WIN (PHP 5+)](https://github.com/jaredallard/phc-win/releases)
